      <description>This is the my first entry in this blog, just to mark the starting point. I am writing this in a train while returning &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; and at this moment, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how the blog will develop. I have some ideas of what I want to share here, but not a concrete plan. Perhaps this will only last a few months until I drop it like many other projects. In any case, what I want to show here are:</description>

      <description>Information Identifying, attributing, and overcoming common data quality issues of manned station observations
 Authors: Hunziker et al. Year: 2017 Journal: International Journal of Climatology DOI: 10.1002/joc.5037 Tags:  [Pe] Peru. [WS] Weather stations. [DQ] Data quality.    Notes Introduction To ensure high quality of climatological analysis (such as trends and extremes), the need of high quality data is a must. As a consequence, quality control becomes then an important step to do.</description>

      <description>I am just a guy from Peru who likes programming, playing with data (if it is climate data, better), and making cool figures. Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS), working on urban climate modelling of biometeorological variables. I have just started so you probably know more about this topic than I do.
Academic background I studied Meteorology at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in Peru, where I started to like programming and climate, and a master&amp;rsquo;s in climate at the Universit√§t Hamburg.</description>
