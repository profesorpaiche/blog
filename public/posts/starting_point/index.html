    <p>This is the my first entry in this blog, just to mark the starting point. I am
writing this in a train while returning &ldquo;home&rdquo; and at this moment, I don&rsquo;t know
how the blog will develop. I have some ideas of what I want to share here, but
not a concrete plan. Perhaps this will only last a few months until I drop it
like many other projects. In any case, what I want to show here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal projects for which I need some motivation.</li>
<li>Some reviews on articles I find interesting.</li>
<li>Share some of my thoughts and knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the first point, my idea is to develop the projects as if they were
<strong>research</strong> projects. However, I don&rsquo;t want to write &ldquo;scientific articles&rdquo;,
I hate the idea of setting the background, explain why the topic is important,
and who else worked on the topic (basically, everything related to the
introduction). I will do it because I want it, that&rsquo;s the motivation. Also,
I will write them in a very informal way, a mixture of <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/">XKCD - What
if?</a> from Randall Munroe and the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso">ENSO
blog</a> from NOAA.</p>
<p>The second point is more for myself, perhaps it will be hard for <em>you</em> to find
the reviews. I need a place where I can find all the articles I&rsquo;ve read in case
I need to check it again for some inspiration.</p>
<p>The third and last point is what most of the blogs are made for. I want to
share my ideas but in a very specific way, creating characters and making
stories. Still, I don&rsquo;t know how this will turn out.</p>
<p>I also consider this blog as a good way to improve my writing skills. I have
a very hard time trying to put into words whatever I have in my mind, so I hope
this blog will help me in this process.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you find the blog interesting in some way and I will always
apreciate any kind of ideas or suggestions.</p>
