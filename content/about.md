I am just a guy from Peru who likes programming, playing with data (if it is
climate data, better), and making cool figures. Currently, I am a PhD candidate
at the Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS), working on urban climate
modelling of biometeorological variables. I have just started so _you_ probably
know more about this topic than I do.

## Academic background

I studied Meteorology at the _Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina_ in Peru,
where I started to like programming and climate, and a master's in climate
at the _Universität Hamburg_. Also, I conducted two research projects for my
bachelor's and master's theses. The first one investigated the effect of
climate on malaria using temporal (wavelet analysis) and spatial (machine
learning) techniques. The second research focused on the variability of extreme
temperatures (heat and cold waves) and a tiny analysis of the impacts on
mortality. As you can see, I also lean a bit towards epidemiology because
I find the links to climate interesting.

## Work experience

I have experience in many different areas, from rainfall analysis and water
resource management to epidemiology and dashboard development.

- **Water resources data analysis:**

I started working at the National Water Authority in 2015. My main tasks were
to clean precipitation data, analyze extreme rainfall events, and monitor the
current droughts and the state of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). All
of this was important for the management of the country's water resources, as
rainfall is the main source of water for rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.

- **Monitoring of extreme events:**

During the summer of 2015-16, I was dispatched to the National Emergency
Operations Center to help monitor extreme events (severe storms, flash floods,
and landslides) related to the 2015-16 El Niño. Additionally, I helped develop
statistical models to predict the increases in river flows and develop an early
warning system based on weather stations.

- **Weather data for malaria modelling:**

In the autumn of 2016, I moved to the General Epidemiology Directorate for
a short time to support the development of malaria models based on weather
data. The idea was to use current and forecast weather data to predict the
incidence rate of malaria through statistical models.

- **Teaching Assistant:**

From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a teaching assistant at the _Universidad
Nacional Agraria La Molina_. I was responsible for the practical lectures on
programming, climate statistics, and remote sensing. I also assisted in the
management of the "Alexander von Humbolt" meteorological observatory and the
Laboratory of Remote Sensing in Meteorology.

- **Conceptualisation of the Water Resource Management Tool:**

Around mid 2019, I returned to the National Water Agency for a few months to
conceptualise a set of water resource management toolboxes to be used by
decision makers. The tools I was responsible for were related to Dam management,
Aquifer management, Extreme weather events, and Climate Change.

- **Dengue, COVID-19, and data management:**

From 2019 to 2020, I worked at the Peruvian Center for Disease Control.
Initially, my work focused on analysing climate and its impact on dengue.
However, COVID-19 started and we were severely understaffed to control the
pandemic, so I had to drop whatever I was doing in order to help the team.
I was good with computers, data cleaning, and Linux, so I set up a virtual
server to process all the data we had. The server also helped with
modelling and automating many processes. Then, I started helping with the
analysis of COVID-19 data and developing dashboards to present all the
data we had.

- **PhD in urban climate modelling:**

I am currently doing my PhD at GERICS. I guess you could call it a job...
