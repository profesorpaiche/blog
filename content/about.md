I am just a guy from Peru that likes do some programming stuff, dealing with some data (if it is climate data, better), and ~~a frustrated artist~~ trying to do some cool figures.

## How it started

I started programming back in university and my first programming language was Fortran. While some of my friends were struggling understanding this old language (and old professor), I don't know how but it just _clicked_ with me. Writing orders, compiling, and watching the terminal spit out some gibberish was so amusing to see, don't know why. Then, I was able to create a very basic and ugly temperature figure with GrADS (my second "programming language"). With these two I knew that **programming** and **visualization** was something I wanted to do.

## And after that?

Right after finishing the university, I got a job at the Peruvian National Water Authority. Here I was in charge of the precipitation data, cleaning it up and making some figures. I got to know people from whom I learnt the basics of process automation. I was also in charge of monitoring El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, and I got to like it. Because of that, I was part of the National Operation Center for Emergencies.

After this I moved for a short period of time to work on a small web-app that facilitates getting weather data at the General Directorate of Epidemiology (which became CDC, more on that later). Although the job couldn't be finished due to political reasons, the web-app is still up and you can check it [here](https://danteca.shinyapps.io/VisMet/) if you are curious.

I ~~was forced~~ decided to take some time of from working and just finish my bachelor's thesis. After working on that, I successfully defend my research by the beginning of 2017. Just after the defense, my supervisor offered me a position as a teaching assistant. Although the payment wasn't the best, I accepted just because of my curiosity about teaching. I spend the next two years as teaching technical skills to students from the meteorology and environmental engineering programs. I would like to go into details about this period of my life, but it will take way to much time and this description is already long. Let's just move on.

It is 2019 and I went back to the National Water Authority for 3 months. I got to work in a very interesting project where the idea was the design of a toolbox for decision-makers. However, a change in the director meant a change of plans so I move out.

Again, a new project between climate and epidemiology appeared at the Peruvian Center for Disease Control (CDC). Funny how my life revolved around the university, water management, and epidemiology. Anyway, it was late 2019 and I was working on climate as a driver for dengue spread in the south of Peru. But in 2020, COVID-19 became a national thread and the CDC was in charge of controlling the disease spread. Since I was not someone with a background in epidemiology, I tried to make myself useful by doing anything people would required regarding data. This is how I started to set up and maintain a virtual server where we could clean all the data we received (which was a lot). I had to learn by myself how to manage a server from almost zero (I already knew Linux, which made things much easier). We tried our best to control de pandemic and we manage to be the country with the highest mortality rate! (what an achievement...).


## Back to studies

In the middle of the pandemic (mid 2020), with very little knowledge about another continent, and even less about the language, I decided to retake my studies and follow a master program in Germany. This was the international program of Integrated Climate System Sciences (such a long name) at the University of Hamburg. It was ... quite an experience. After two and a half years I finished the program with the defense of my master's thesis about extreme temperature events and its effects over mortality in Peru.

## So now ...

I few months after the master (or a few months ago), I got accepted for a Ph.D. position at the Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS), which is were I am right now. The topic is about urban climate modeling. I cannot talk too much about this yet, since I am only 3 months in, but maybe you will see some post related to that in my blog.
