This is the my first entry in this blog, just to mark the starting point. I am
writing this in a train while returning "home" and at this moment, I don't know
how the blog will develop. I have some ideas of what I want to share here, but
not a concrete plan. Perhaps this will only last a few months until I drop it
like many other projects. In any case, what I want to show here are:

1. Personal projects for which I need some motivation.
2. Some reviews on articles I find interesting.
3. Share some of my thoughts and knowledge.

Regarding the first point, my idea is to develop the projects as if they were
**research** projects. However, I don't want to write "scientific articles",
I hate the idea of setting the background, explain why the topic is important,
and who else worked on the topic (basically, everything related to the
introduction). I will do it because I want it, that's the motivation. Also,
I will write them in a very informal way, a mixture of [XKCD - What
if?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) from Randall Munroe and the [ENSO
blog](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso) from NOAA.

The second point is more for myself, perhaps it will be hard for _you_ to find
the reviews. I need a place where I can find all the articles I've read in case
I need to check it again for some inspiration.

The third and last point is what most of the blogs are made for. I want to
share my ideas but in a very specific way, creating characters and making
stories. Still, I don't know how this will turn out.

I also consider this blog as a good way to improve my writing skills. I have
a very hard time trying to put into words whatever I have in my mind, so I hope
this blog will help me in this process.

Anyway, I hope you find the blog interesting in some way and I will always
apreciate any kind of ideas or suggestions.
