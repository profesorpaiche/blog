A few years ago, a fellow _**Jurel**_ ([_**Pacific Jack
Mackerel**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_jack_mackerel) for my
English-speaking readers) asked me if it was possible to get climate
information at a district level from gridded data. I did not hesitate to answer
_"Yes!"_, thinking _"Surely someone has thought of this... Of course there must
be a library out there that intersects gridded and polygon data"_. Well, there
was not, or perhaps I was not using Google properly (would not be the first
time).

In any case, I had to come up with a solution, and so the first version of my
package "[polilla](https://github.com/profesorpaiche/polilla)" (moth in
English) came to life. Nowadays this task can easily be done with R packages
like "[exactextractr](https://isciences.gitlab.io/exactextractr/)" or
"[stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/)", though I have not tried them
myself.

Years later, a fellow _**Alaskan pollock**_ had the same request. Climate data
at district level. This time I felt more confident to do it because I knew
about the new packages mentioned earlier. However, I encountered a little tiny
small problem. You see, for this task I have access to one of the most powerful
and chunky computers for research purposes. But that's the catch, I only have
**access** to it, which means I cannot install R packages that require new
software or system libraries. This made it "impossible" for me to test the new
packages.

> For the record, I **could** have asked the admins to install the required
libraries, but I only have enough courage to talk to the fellow fish sitting
3 meters away from me. Also, I **could** have used Python, but despite knowing
how to handle it, I despise any kind of [nope
ropes](https://youtu.be/0arsPXEaIUY?si=xqDBtQhg5GiWDkE0)... I am a fish after
all...

So, defeated and depressed, I decided it was time to dust off my old `polilla`
package and make it useful again since it did not require installing anything
extra.

## It was not yet a polilla, but a cocoon

This is what my package used to do:

1. Using latitude and longitude coordinates as centroids, it created a mesh or
   grid of square polygons.
2. It overlapped the grid with another polygon (like a district) and calculated
   the intersected fraction of the area (useful for weighted averages).

Very simple and it just worked. Unfortunately, I could not use it because my
package expected the classic
[WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84)
longitude/latitude projection, but my data was in a weird projection called
"rotated pole". To put it simply, this projection sets the pair of coordinates
(0째, 0째) somewhere in Europe to make the grid centers in Europe "equally"
spaced. There is no need to dig too deeply into this, but if you are curious,
this is an example of what the centroids look like in the rotated pole
projection.

## Starting the metamorphosis

Fixing the projection issue was quite simple, all I had to do was add an extra
argument to each function so that I could pass any projection I wanted. Then
you might think that updating the functions should be enough, right? I just
need to pass the right projection, right?

{{< img mouse="Wait... that's illegal" src="/img/posts/23-11-15-Making_grids/f02.png" >}}

Uhmm... that did not work as planned. The centroids of the new grid (red squares)
should be at the same position as the original coordinates (white circles).
Instead, there is a strange offset.

After hours and hours of swimming in circles, I realised what the problem was.
If you have been paying attention, you might remember something about the grids
being "equally" spaced. Well, the original coordinates are indeed equally
spaced, but **in degrees**. The moment I transformed the centroids to this
rotated pole projection, the coordinates were converted to **meters**, thus
making them not equally spaced. This is not an error or a bug, it is just the
way projections work and why they are a [pain in the tail](https://xkcd.com/977/).

I do not know if this can be fixed by working in degrees instead of meters, but
at least I had found a way to reduce the offset (and improve performance!).
You see, the further away the centroids are from the origin (0째, 0째), the
greater the distance between them and the greater the offset. But by creating
the grid on a smaller area (say the boundaries of the city of Hanover), the
distance between the centroids remains relatively constant compared to using
the whole country.

OK, it worked, but we have another problem. Simply using the bounding box of
the desired polygon (Fig 3. - purple dotted line) to select the desired grids is not
enough. This is because the bounding box only intersects the grid centroids,
not the area covered by the grid itself. I could create the grid first and then
do the selection, but I would be back to the problem of mismatched centroids.
Instead, I can just extend the bounding box by half the resolution of the grid
cells (Fig. 4 - new purple dashed line).

Nice... Now the final step is to calculate the intersection area between the
grids and the reference polygon. Based on this, we can also calculate the
weights in case we want to use them for spatial statistics (like averages for
the whole district). This can easily be done with functions from the `sf`
package.

## It is a beautiful... moth...

And it is done. Having the weights for each grid cell is enough to get area
averaged climate values for different districts. As I said before, this can be
done with other packages but, this is just another option.

On a more personal note, this makes me understand much better why projections
are so important and that things do not have to be perfect to be
useful. I cannot say that the grids produced by `polilla` are accurate, as
it assume an equally spaced grid when in fact it is not. However, the error
is so small that it makes no difference to the spatial statistics.

Now fly, you ugly moth.
